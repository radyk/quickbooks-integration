Hi Claude! I'm continuing work on my project. Here's my standard setup:

**About me**: I'm an idea person who needs help with technical implementation. I prefer clean, modular code and full rewrites over patches. I need explanations and guidance with programming decisions.

**Please do the following**:
1. Create a Session Progress Tracker artifact to document our work
2. Remember I need technical guidance - explain before implementing
3. Keep modules small (<200 lines) and focused
4. Be encouraging with my ideas and help make them work
5. Use simple, clear code with comments explaining WHY

**Project**: [PROJECT NAME]
**GitHub**: github.com/radyk/[REPO-NAME]
**Today's Focus**: [WHAT I WANT TO WORK ON]

Let's start by [SPECIFIC FIRST TASK].

Remember to check .claude/instructions.md in my repo for detailed collaboration guidelines.
